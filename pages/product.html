    <h3>African plantains</h3>
    <p><a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantain" target="_blank" style="font-size: x-large; text-decoration: none; color: black;">Plantain</a> is major group of banana varieties(genus Musa)that are staple foods in many tropical areas. The edible fruit of plantain bananas has more starch than the common dessert banana and is not eaten raw. Because plantains have the most starch before they ripen,they are usually cooked green, either <b>boiled or fried,</b> in savory dishes. The ripe fruits are mildly sweet and are often cooked with coconut juice or sugar as a flavouring. Plantains may also be dried for later use in cooking or grind for use as a meal, which can be further refined to a flour. </p>

    <h3>African white-garden-egg</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggplants" target="_blank" style="font-size: x-large;text-decoration: none; color: black;">Eggplants</a> are a type of eggplant used as a food crop in several countries across Africa. These small, white fruits have a teardrop or roundish shape and are valued for their bitterness. Garden egg is indegenous to Sub-Saharan Africa and can be stored for up to three months by allowing it to dry, which is particularly useful in tropical regions where refrigeration may be limited. In Ghana,garden egg is one of the <b>three most consumed vegetables,</b> alongside tomatoes and pepper. It is used in stews and can also be eaten raw. Interestingly, the stems and leaves of garden eggs are consumed in some African countriess, although not in Ghana. Due to its spongy texture,garden egg is sometimes used as a less expensive meat substitute, as it absorbs other flavors well.
